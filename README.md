# Poultry-Farming
We are a team of six students assigned to develop a poultry farming Guide subsystem. Once developed, the system will provide information to new poultry farmers on how best they can manage their poultry. 
The functional requirements for this system are as follows:
1.	Display diseases and vaccines for chickens. The system should display a picture(s) of a chicken suffering from a particular disease.
2.	Display preventive measure which should be taken for such diseases
3.	Display ideal feeding/vaccination program at every stage of chickens growth
4.	Recommend number of feeders and drinkers to be used at every stage of chickenâ€™s growth
5.	Recommend the amount of space required for a given number of full grown chicken
6.	Provide information about chemists/drug stores where vaccines can be acquired/purchased 
7.	Provide the latest information about the trends in poultry farming
